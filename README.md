# 🗳️ Live Poll Battle

**Live Poll Battle** is a real-time multiplayer polling app where users can create or join rooms, vote between two options (e.g., "Cats vs Dogs"), and view live results with a 60-second timer. The app is fully real-time using WebSockets, includes a dark mode toggle, vote chart visualization, and a modern user experience.
